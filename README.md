dotfiles
===

My personal dotfiles for my GNU machines.

Installing
---

It's suposed to be cloned in a `.dotfiles` folder right in a user's home:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/Roboe/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then, execute the `0_unroll.sh` script to create symbolic links:

```
cd ~/.dotfiles
./0_unroll.sh
```
